### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My journey to software development started at college. From Python/Django for college project to Ruby on Rails in the internship, I finally ended up with JavaScript/NodeJs. These days I'm mainly focusing on full-stack development.

I like to share the knowledge that I've gained through my professional and personal experience in software development via blog posts and video tutorials. I occasionally contribute to open-source. It helps me keep up to date with programming and development.
